# Replication-Materials-for-Tweetment-Effects-on-the-Tweeted

This repository contains replication materials for the Political Behavior article (Munger, 2016). <i>Tweetment Effects on the Tweeted: Experimentally Reducing Online Harassment.</i>

All of the data provided has been calculated from word counts collected from subjects' Twitter accounts. In order to protect subjects' privacy, the raw text is not avaliable; even a single tweet can be enough to uniquely identify a user.

To replicate the figures in both the body of the text and the appendix, first run read_in_data_fit_models.R. Choose to read in the data from the body of the text (main assumption) or appendix (conservative assumption). Then run plot_results.R. Choose to plot the pooled models or the models with subgroup analysis based on the subjects' anonymity.
